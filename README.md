# Project Curator

A convenient tool to cleanup and maintain your Unity projects !    
**Project Curator** is an Unity Editor window that, based on the currently selected Asset, displays the following information :

- Each asset it depends on (called **dependencies**)

- Each asset that depends on it (called **referencers**)  
  *Very useful to know if an Asset is can be safely deleted or not*

- Whether the asset is included in the build or not, depending on the nature of the Asset and its referencers (checked recursively)  
  *Check statuses section for more information*

## How to use ?
- Install package
  - Using Git : In Unity, click **Window > Package Manager > + > Add package from git URL...** and add `git@github.com:ogxd/project-curator.git`
  - Manually : Download the .zip, unzip and in Unity click **Window > Package Manager > + > Add package from disck...** and select the downloaded `package.json`
  - ~~With Unitypackage : Download the .unitypackage in the release tab.~~ *Not available anymore since version 1.2*
- When installed in Unity, click **Window > Project Curator** (and dock the window somewhere maybe)
- Select an asset to visualize dependencies and referencers.

> You will need to Rebuild the database on the first run. There should be a button for it in the window (or do a right click on the window tab). The database should update automatically afterwards, even when assets are created, moved or deleted. Feel free to rebuild the database again if there is an issue.

  - **Runtime Script**  
    *The asset is a runtime script*
  - **Resource Asset**  
    *The asset is in a Resources folder and will end in the final build  
    It does not mean that the asset is actually useful. Check referencers manually and Resources.Load calls to find out*
